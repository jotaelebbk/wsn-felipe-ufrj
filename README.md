# WSN simulator
A Wireless Sensor Network simulator in Python and C++ (via SWIG).

It basically simulates the communication among nodes and communication with the base station. It has a energy model that helps estimates the network lifetime. It has some pre-defined scenarios (including clustering techniques):
- Direct Communication (from nodes directly to the base station);
- [MTE](#ref1)
- [LEACH](#ref2)
- [FCM](#ref3)

It also implements a modified version of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) in order to schedule sleeping slots to every node at every communication round. This implementation is based on [this paper](#ref4), but contains improvements, specially concerning the learning of better solutions. [NSGA-II](#ref5) is also implemented.

# Running it
1. Choose your settings in the configuration file (config.py)

2. Compile C++/Python wrappers: python setup.py build_ext --inplace

3. python run.py

# Requirements
All non-trivial requirements (the ones you cannot get via pip install) are inside this repository.

# Minha contribuicao:
Enquanto estagiava na UFRJ minha missao foi criar um novo uso para o codigo original atualizando ele (como sempre ocorreu com esse projeto), implementamos alguns algoritmos novos, trabalhamos os dados gerados e no fim tivemos um otimo projeto.
